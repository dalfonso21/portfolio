    <h1>Dance</h1>
    <p>I've loved to dance since I was a little kid. I started taking it in elementary. Dance is so fun to me because you can express yourself through the movements and I like to show people what I can do.It makes me excited and pumped because I enjoy it. I love performing in front of my school and friends. Its nice when they cheer me on.</p>
